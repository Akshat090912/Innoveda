## Smart Vehicles with Proximity Management, Pothole Detection, and Speed Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety and driving efficiency through the integration of advanced sensors and On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) data. The system offers three core functionalities:
1. *Proximity Management*: Real-time monitoring of nearby vehicles and obstacles.
2. *Pothole Detection*: Identification of potholes using OBD data and machine learning.
3. *Speed Detection*: Dynamic tracking of vehicle speed against geo-referenced speed limits.

The solution culminates in a web-based dashboard providing actionable insights and data visualization.

## Features
- *Proximity Management*: Alerts drivers to nearby objects, reducing the risk of collisions.
- *Pothole Detection*: Collects and processes data for pothole identification and reporting.
- *Speed Detection*: Monitors vehicle speed and ensures adherence to traffic regulations.
- *Web Dashboard*: Displays real-time data, insights, and reports for users and administrators.

## Technologies Used
### Hardware:
- Ultrasonic sensors for proximity detection.
- Accelerometers and gyroscopes for pothole detection.
- OBD-II system for vehicle diagnostics and data collection.

### Software:
- *Backend*: Python/JavaScript for data processing and analytics.
- *Frontend*: Dash/React for dashboard development.
- *Machine Learning*: Algorithms for anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

## System Workflow
1. *Data Collection*: Sensors and OBD systems gather real-time data.
2. *Edge Processing*: Local devices preprocess and analyze the raw inputs.
3. *Cloud Integration*: Data is sent to the cloud for advanced analytics.
4. *Dashboard Visualization*: Insights and alerts are displayed on a user-friendly web interface.
